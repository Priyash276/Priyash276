My Name is Priyash Khandelwal

I am a management student with a passion for data. I believe that data is the key to understanding the world and making better decisions. I have always been fascinated by how data can reveal patterns, trends, insights, and opportunities that are otherwise hidden or overlooked.
I have been developing my skills in data analytics and data science through various courses, projects.
I am always eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge in the field of data.
